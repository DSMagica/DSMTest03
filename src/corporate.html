      <h2>The Kehew Construction Process</h2>
      <h3>Pre-Contract Stage</h3>
      <p>
        Before a contract is written, we meet with potential clients to discuss objectives, plans, and requirements. We help with financing and review construction needs—from parking and garage bays to site layout and renderings—ensuring you get an optimal building design.
      </p>
      <h3>Contract Stage</h3>
      <p>
        In this stage, we finalize the key terms. Whether you choose a Design-Build model, Construction Management, or a traditional Design-Bid-Build method, our goal is to add value and secure a Firm Fixed Price by assuming full responsibility for cost overruns.
